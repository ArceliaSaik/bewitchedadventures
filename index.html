            <p>I miss the green grass, the tall trees, and the abundance of flowers from Indiana but the Arizona desert has its own unique beauty that I don't really want to go far from.  I've fallen in love with my environment and am happy to stay in Arizona where so many biomes are not far from me.</p>
            <p>Nature and religion have always inspired and called to me.  Together these things have helped me develop a beautiful spirituality and educational background that are very nature centered.  My passion in life is to help people and bring myself a sense of peace through helping myself as much as I help others.  I feel that it is very important at this point in my life to rediscover myself and figure out how to implement peace in my life through nature, mindfulness, and spirituality.</p>
            <p>I am a survivor and I live my life day to day trying to make the best out of what I have.  Although it isn't always the easiest thing to remain optimistic, I feel I do a pretty good job most days.</p>
            <p>I have loving friends and family that are never far away.  I want us all to have fun and be at peace.  And I want to inspire those around me to have fun and be at peace in their lives.</p>
            <p>So let's laugh and dream together.</p>
