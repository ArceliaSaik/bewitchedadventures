          <p>
            Hello!
          </p>
          <p
          >My nick name is Spirit so that is what I'll be going by on this site.  Let me tell you just a bit about myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am 31 years old (2022) and I live in the Phoenix Metro area.  I am interested in all kinds of things from video games and music to art and writing.  I have an Associates Degree in
          Holistic Healthcare and a Bachelor's degree in Alternative Medicine.  My intention is to persue my Master's degree and become a Physician's Asssistant.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy creative things like making bracelets from beads and rubberbands, crocheting, writing, Roleplaying, sometimes drawing, web designing, photomanipulation, photography, and
            I'm even learning to play the piano.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a normal person with normal struggles and I intend to talk about that some here on Bewitched Adventures.  I'm hoping not to make it a pity party but rather a sharing of my own
            struggles so that others can relate and maybe take away some skills to help themselves...  as I will also share what I'm doing to work on my mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love the cold.  Not the freezing mind... but cold.  I do love to look at snow and ice but I don't want to live with it and am happily planning to stay in the desert.
            I do not enjoy the heat so much which puts me at odds with the desert weather in the summer  but since we get some monsoon season rain to cool us off... I guess I can survive!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not single!  I have a loving boyfriend and his daughter in my life and I adore them both.  I struggled to find the right puzzle pieces to make my life whole but I've finally
            found some amazing people to call mine and really know I am safe and loved.  I was married before and that didn't go so well so I am happy to be taking things nice and slow and Let
            a more mature relationship develop between us.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is me!  Spirit! If you have any questions for me please see my contact information below.
