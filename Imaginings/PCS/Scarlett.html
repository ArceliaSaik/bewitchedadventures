            <strong>About Once Upon a Mystery Bed and Breakfast:</strong> The small mansion masquerades as an upscale Bed & Breakfast and acts as supplementary income, Scarlett's home on Ravnica, as well as her P.I. Office when she's not doing official work for the Azorius Senate.  It is peaceful and classy establishment with only 9 rooms open to patrons (3 singles, 4 doubles, and 2 triples) and a penthouse for herself.  She usually hosts clients at the B&B while she works on cases for them or for teammates who she needs close by.  There is a small amphitheater with a stage at the bottom, a sizable lounge with a fully stocked bar and a dance floor flanked by small curtained alcoves equipped with booths, and there are 24/7 butlers and maids serving the establishment.   Surrounding the establishment is a small garden packed with fragrant and beautiful flowering plants, as many blooming at night as during the day.   The Bed & Breakfast sits in Gate Watch Plaza and was funded by a mysterious white-haired man that no one knows much about.  Whoever her patron is it is rumored that she did him a great service to win his favor to that degree.
